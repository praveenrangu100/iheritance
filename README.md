# iheritance
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one class (called the subclass or derived class) inherits the properties and methods of another class (called the superclass or base class). The subclass can add new properties and methods, but it cannot change the properties and methods of the superclass. This allows for code reuse and a more organized and maintainable codebase. The keyword "extends" is used to indicate that a class is a subclass of another class.
